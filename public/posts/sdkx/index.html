              GreedyGame&#39;s former SDK : SDK 8 is a library for Android game developers to integrate ads in their apps for monetisation. SDK 8 can served ads from multiple ad inventories including Google AdMob, Facebook Ads, and in-house demand. The differentiating factor among the other alternatives in the ease of Native ads integration. 
Integrated with around 700 games, the SDK serves around 1B Ad requests per month. To rethink the product cycle and onboarding for SDK developers; SDK itself needed to be rethought.

              <h4>Onboarding Process</h4>
              <p class="fs-5">An integration cycle would start with the Sales team pitching it to the publishers, once a publisher is willing to integrate the SDK in their Android app, the design team would come up with suggestions for the ad placements and mocks, post that once everyone gets on the same page, the developer would go through the Docs on the website for the instructions to integrate using Android Studio.</p>

              <h4>Ad Unit dimension inconsistency</h4>
              <p class="fs-5">In the SDK 8 integration cycle, the designers from GreedyGame would design mocks in Photoshop which displayed ads over the screenshots to depict how the ad designs will look like when integrated. Once the app publisher approved of the placements, they would need to create ad units on the panel with an input box requesting dimensions. They did not understand what the actual values represented and how does it affect the actual ad size on Android phones.</p>

              <h4>Unable to check sample Test Ads until the SDK is implemented</h4>
              <p class="fs-5">Once a developer integrated the SDK, it was a tedious task to get the sample test ads, to verify the implementation. The developers took about an hour in average to setup test ads in multiple devices. They had to verify the ad implementations such as refresh time, loading time, debugging the issues, and checking for design alignment. The process is different from Google&#39;s AdMob SDK and since a lot of developers were coming from those lines, this method seemed a little unusual and added to bad user experience.</p>

              <p class="fs-5">For each native ad space and each app a publisher integrated GreedyGame SDK in, graphic designers at GreedyGame had to design JSON template for the specific Ad Size, incorporating assets that matched the app&#39;s UI. This required a lot of man hours and monotonous activities that could be automated.</p>

                <p class="fs-5">To start off, I created a provisional persona of a potential developer and a publisher based off the dataset of 100s of past clients that have integrated GreedyGame&#39;s SDK into their apps. They are either developers or publishers; this persona was created with assumptions and not fully research-based but it was something that I came back to throughout my project to guide my design decisions and priorities. I also created a user flow to show the flow for a publisher who wants to integrate SDK in his app. The highlighted areas represent the first 3 pain points which I will tacle in my design solutions.</p>

                <p class="fs-5">There are a multiple ways in which a View can be defined in Android. I have designed a decision tree which selects an appropriate ad design XML on the basis of the height and width of the ad space. The size of the text, icon, button; the location of various elements are chosen automatically. This enables the developer to visualise a Test Ad as soon as it is implemented and the size and placement can be changed accordingly in no time. This saves a lot of time in the integration process.</p>

I had conducted Design sessions where the different dimensions that the Android developers are familiar with were explained to the employees at GreedyGame to bring everyone to the same page.</p>

If for some reason you want to see the test ads on a release build, you can enable the enableDebug(true) method in the AppConfig Builder as a part of the SDK initialization.</p>

Analysing over 1800 recordings in the first month, we found that the users were able to navigate and perform the tasks on the dashboard quicker as compared to the previous dashboard. Few users were unable to unable to understand the procedure after adding the ad units as they were not used to AdMob terminologies. However, the initial target audience for SDK X were users aquatinted with AdMob hence this issue can be considered insignificant.</p>
